# Memory Game!
* This game will test your memory
* The objective of the game is to click on a card you haven't already clicked.
* Every new card you click will earn you 1 point
* Clicking the same card twice will make you loose all your points
* Once you click a card the game will re-shuffle each card position
* Try to remember which card you already clicked and earn as many points as you can.
* Have fun!!
